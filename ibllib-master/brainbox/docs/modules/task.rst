`brainbox.task`: Tools for computing task-related neural activity
=================================================================

The `task` module is a toolkit for examining the relationship between the activity of single or
multiple units in a recording and task-related variables. We aim for these functions
to be general enough to apply to tasks beyond the IBL, and input is greatly appreciated.
