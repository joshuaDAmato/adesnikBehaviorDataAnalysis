`brainbox.simulation`: Tools for simulating data
===============================================================

The `simulation` module is intended to be a place for functions that simulate data in a very simple
way. Brainbox does not aim to supplant the many other excellent neural simulation projects, such as
Brian, and as such this module is limited to only basic synthetic data generation for testing
purposes.
